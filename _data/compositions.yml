        Generic arrangement implementing more arpeggios to heighten
        the intensity of the repeating melodies

        4-hands arrangement intended for a duet.

      summary: >
        Generic 3-part structure with no chord change, 
        overall song is repetitive and thus requires 
        strict dynamic variation to create distinct voices

      summary: >
        I tried implementing complex chords to create 
        a dreamy and floating feeling during the chorus. 
        Song is slow and generally quiet.

    用背脊唱情歌:
      date: 2025-08-05
      summary: >
        This song involves a long quiet session with an explosive final chorus
         which uses 4-5 octave range to bring out the intensity. 
         The chorus is extremely dependent on rubato and dynamic control.

      summary: >
        Simple transcription with large chords to form ambient noise. 
        The prechorus is extremely vocal-dominant and pedal control is crucial.

      summary: >
        One of my best arrangements using an excessive amount of density to illustrate
        the strong ambient noise of guitar and echo in the original song. Difficulty is
        high because of the strong rhythmic control and regular overlapping of notes
        requiring percise release and pedal release to isolate the dominant sounds.

        My first ever full original composition. I utilised jazz chords and interesting
